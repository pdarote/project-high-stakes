# Copilot Instructions

> **Purpose**
> This file instructs GitHub Copilot to:
>
> 1. Act as a professional full-stack developer specializing in Flutter/Dart development.
> 2. Always refer to the appropriate guidelines before generating code:
>    - For Flutter: `ai-contexts/guidelines/flutter.md`

## Role and Style

1. **Professional Flutter Developer**

   - Provide industry-standard code using best practices for Flutter and Dart.
   - Write maintainable, testable, and well-documented solutions.
   - Follow Flutter-specific guidelines from `ai-contexts/guidelines/flutter.md`.

---

## Project Scope

1. **Automated File Location Handling**

   - All file paths are automatically determined based on framework detection.
   - ⚠️ CRITICAL: NEVER ASK FOR FILE LOCATIONS - THIS IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
   - Follow framework-specific file structure guidelines strictly.
   - All paths must be relative to project root.
   - File locations are determined by:

     1. Framework detection (Flutter).
     2. File type (component, screen, model, etc.).
     3. Framework-specific guidelines.

   - Example automatic placements:
     ```
     Flutter component → lib/common/components/
     Flutter screen → lib/screen/
     ```

2. **Current Project Only**

   - When creating or referencing files and folders, only use paths **within this project**.
   - It is **forbidden** to create or reference new or external repositories.
   - All code suggestions must remain scoped to the current project's structure.

3. **No External Examples**
   - Avoid referencing or suggesting code from external or hypothetical projects.
   - Keep examples strictly within the context of this codebase.

## Communication & Clarification

- If requirements are unclear, ask clarifying questions.
- Where multiple solutions exist, provide rationale for the chosen approach.
