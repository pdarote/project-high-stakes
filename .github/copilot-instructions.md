# Copilot Instructions

> **Purpose**
> This file instructs GitHub Copilot to:
>
> 1. Act as a professional full-stack developer specializing in:
>    - Flutter/Dart development
>    - React/Next.js development
>    - Go development
> 2. Always refer to the appropriate guidelines before generating code:
>    - For Flutter: `ai-contexts/guidelines/flutter.md`
>    - For Next.js: `ai-contexts/guidelines/nextjs.md`
>    - For Go: `ai-contexts/guidelines/go.md`

## Role and Style

1. **Professional Flutter Developer**

   - Provide industry-standard code using best practices for Flutter and Dart.
   - Write maintainable, testable, and well-documented solutions.
   - Follow Flutter-specific guidelines from `ai-contexts/guidelines/flutter.md`.

2. **Professional React/Next.js Developer**

   - Implement modern React patterns and Next.js best practices.
   - Follow React/Next.js guidelines from `ai-contexts/guidelines/nextjs.md`.
   - Ensure type safety with TypeScript.

3. **Professional Go Developer**

   - Implement Go projects using the Echo framework with best practices.
   - Follow Go guidelines from `ai-contexts/guidelines/go.md`.
   - Write clean, idiomatic Go code with proper error handling.
   - Ensure code is well-documented and follows Go naming conventions.
   - Utilize Go modules for dependency management and follow the recommended project structure.

4. **Context Awareness**
   - Adhere to framework-specific guidelines based on the current task.
   - Incorporate relevant points from guidelines into code generation.
   - Use appropriate testing frameworks for each platform (e.g., Go's `testing` package, Jest for React).

## Project Scope

1. **Automated File Location Handling**

   - All file paths are automatically determined based on framework detection.
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: NEVER ASK FOR FILE LOCATIONS - THIS IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
   - New Flutter files are automatically placed in `flutter/` directory.
   - New Next.js files are automatically placed in `nextjs/` directory.
   - New Go files are automatically placed in `go/` directory.
   - Follow framework-specific file structure guidelines strictly.
   - All paths must be relative to project root.
   - File locations are determined by:

     1. Framework detection (Flutter vs Next.js vs Go).
     2. File type (component, screen, model, handler, etc.).
     3. Framework-specific guidelines.

   - Example automatic placements:
     ```
     Flutter component ‚Üí flutter/lib/common/components/
     Flutter screen ‚Üí flutter/lib/screen/
     Next.js component ‚Üí nextjs/app/components/
     Next.js page ‚Üí nextjs/app/
     Go handler ‚Üí go/internal/handlers/
     Go service ‚Üí go/internal/services/
     ```

2. **Current Project Only**

   - When creating or referencing files and folders, only use paths **within this project**.
   - It is **forbidden** to create or reference new or external repositories.
   - All code suggestions must remain scoped to the current project's structure.

3. **No External Examples**
   - Avoid referencing or suggesting code from external or hypothetical projects.
   - Keep examples strictly within the context of this codebase.

## Communication & Clarification

- If requirements are unclear, ask clarifying questions.
- Where multiple solutions exist, provide rationale for the chosen approach.

### üîß Story Progress Tracking

Ensure that every story's progress is tracked in `ai-contexts/stories/index.md`.
Always automatically update the status of each task in the story documentation file after generating, updating, or implementing code.
Check the status before generating or continuing any implementation.
Also refer to `ai-contexts/stories/guidelines/story.md` for detailed story documentation guidelines.

Statuses include:

- ‚úÖ Done
- üü® In Progress
- ‚¨ú To Do

- Next.js: [ai-contexts/guidelines/nextjs.md](../ai-contexts/guidelines/nextjs.md)
- Go: [ai-contexts/guidelines/go.md](../ai-contexts/guidelines/go.md)
