└─ lib/
   ├─ main.dart
   ├─ common/
   ├─ screens/
   ├─ theme/
   ├─ models/
   ├─ services/
   ├─ utils/
   └─ ... (platform folders: android/, ios/, web/, linux/, macos/, windows/)

## 📝 Implementation Steps

## 🚨 Implementation Approval Process

1. **Story Creation**
   - First, create and document the story
   - Get approval on the story structure and requirements
2. **Implementation Steps**
   - After story approval, present the proposed file changes
   - Wait for explicit approval before creating or modifying any files
   - Never create or modify files without prior approval
3. **Review Process**
   - Present file changes in a structured format
   - List all files that will be created or modified
   - Get explicit approval before proceeding with implementation
4. **Approval Format**
   The user must explicitly approve:
   - Story structure and requirements
   - Proposed file changes
   - Implementation approach

Note: Do not create or modify any files until receiving explicit approval from the user.
