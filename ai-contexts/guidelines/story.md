Story Documentation Guidelines

## 📚 Overview

This document outlines the standard structure and guidelines for creating and maintaining story documentation in your Flutter project. Each story must follow a consistent format and include a task status tracker to monitor progress at a granular level.

## 🚨 Implementation Approval Process

1. **Story Creation**

   - First, create and document the story
   - Get approval on the story structure and requirements

2. **Implementation Steps**

   - After story approval, present the proposed file changes
   - Wait for explicit approval before creating or modifying any files
   - Never create or modify files without prior approval

3. **Review Process**

   - Present file changes in a structured format
   - List all files that will be created or modified
   - Get explicit approval before proceeding with implementation

4. **Approval Format**
   The user must explicitly approve:
   - Story structure and requirements
   - Proposed file changes
   - Implementation approach

Note: Do not create or modify any files until receiving explicit approval from the user.

## 🧑‍💻 Example

### Example Story: `ABC01.md`

# ABC01 - Implement Login Screen
